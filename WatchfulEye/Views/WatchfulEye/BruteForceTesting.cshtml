        Brute Force Attacks are a common form of cyber attack. A hacker will will attempt to guess your password using an algorithm that will iterate through as many combinations
        as possible with the goal of eventually getting access to your account.
    </p>
    <p>
        Different Brute Force Attack methods:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Quickly testing combinations of random characters at increasing volumes.
        </li>
         <li>
            Recycling combinations of usernames and passwords from other sources, and iterating through each of them at a rapid pace.
        </li>
        <li>
            Iterating through a list of users and attempting a single common passphrase.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Brute force attacks specialize in targeting users with passwords that are simple, common and reused. In order to counterract this attack, users should take advantage of the
        following practices:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Create passwords that use special characters, are of a substantial length, and do not include common phrases (like password, test, etc)
        </li>
        <li>
            Take advantage of secondary authentication measures, such as 2-Factor-Authentication.
        </li>
         <li>
            Avoiding the reuse of passwords to prevent an attacker from accessing anything else in the event of a successful breach.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        Types of Brute force attacks:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Simple brute force attack: A simple brute force attack uses automation and scripts to guess passwords.
        </li>
        <li>
            Dictionary Attack: A dictionary attack tries combinations of common words and phrases.
        </li>
        <li>
            Credential Stuffing: A credential stuffing attack uses these stolen login combinations across a multitude of sites.
        </li>
        <li>
            Reverse Brute Force Attack: In reverse brute force attack, the attacker knows the password and needs to find the username or account number.
        </li>
        <li>
            Hybrid Brute Force Attack: A hybrid brute force attack combines a dictionary attack and a brute force attack.
        </li>
        <li>
            Password Spraying: A Password spraying attack takes the opposite approach and tries to apply one common password to many accounts.
        </li>
        <li>
            Botnets: A brute force attack is a numbers game, and it takes a lot of computing power to execute at scale.
        </li>
    </ul>
