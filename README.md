# WatchfulEye

<b>WatchfulEye</b> is an application to teach end users about the severity of knowing the basics of Cybersecurity. They will be able to create an account to see how phishing, hashing, and brute force tactics are deployed. This application provides an educational but interactive approach to Cybersecurity basics. The application provides examples of different threats that the average end user might face daily. Users will have the chance to view how hackers try to steal their information and how the more security they put in place the better secure their information will be. 

## About
Our project was inspired by our experience in the workforce. While working in our co-op or full-time jobs, we’ve come to notice the trend of basic consumers being targeted and not well informed of the dangers that lurk behind the screen. Basic consumers are only informed about the dangers from viruses but not about the dangers of hackers\scammers. Doing a quick Google search shows there’s a majority high level cybersecurity course but lacks the basic skills consumers should know to protect themselves. Our project team formed during the first class dedicated to finding a group. All five of us joined the same call and focused on getting to know each other, then focused on what we thought we could do for senior design. We discussed issues, and solutions for a few days and produced this idea. The requirement analysis was done by our whole team.
